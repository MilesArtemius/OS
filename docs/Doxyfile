# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the
# first line (until the first dot) of a Javadoc-style comment as the brief

# By default Python docstrings are displayed as preformatted text and doxygen's

# If the SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES tag is set to YES then doxygen will produce a new

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C sources

# When TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT tag is enabled, a typedef of a struct, union, or

# with name TypeT. When disabled the typedef will appear as a member of a file,
# namespace, or class. And the struct will be named TypeS. This can typically be
# useful for C code in case the coding convention dictates that all compound
# types are typedef'ed and only the typedef is referenced, never the tag name.
# The default value is: NO.

TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT = NO

# The NUM_PROC_THREADS specifies the number threads doxygen is allowed to use
# during processing. When set to 0 doxygen will based this on the number of
# cores available in the system. You can set it explicitly to a value larger
# than 0 to get more control over the balance between CPU load and processing
# speed. At this moment only the input processing can be done using multiple
# threads. Since this is still an experimental feature the default is set to 1,
# which efficively disables parallel processing. Please report any issues you
# encounter. Generating dot graphs in parallel is controlled by the
# DOT_NUM_THREADS setting.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 32, default value: 1.

# If the CLANG_ASSISTED_PARSING tag is set to YES then doxygen will use the

# The HTML_EXTRA_FILES tag can be used to specify one or more extra images or

# that these files will be copied to the base HTML output directory. Use the
# $relpath^ marker in the HTML_HEADER and/or HTML_FOOTER files to load these

# If the HTML_DYNAMIC_MENUS tag is set to YES then the generated HTML

# consists of multiple levels of tabs that are statically embedded in every HTML
# page. Disable this option to support browsers that do not have JavaScript,
# like the Qt help browser.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_DYNAMIC_MENUS = YES

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. If the tag
# value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated containing a tree-like
# index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this
# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom style sheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine-tune the look of the index. As an example, the default style
# sheet generated by doxygen has an example that shows how to put an image at
# the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME. Since the tree basically has
# the same information as the tab index, you could consider setting
# DISABLE_INDEX to YES when enabling this option.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW = YES

# If the EXT_LINKS_IN_WINDOW option is set to YES, doxygen will open links to

# Enable the USE_MATHJAX option to render LaTeX formulas using MathJax (see
# https://www.mathjax.org) which uses client side JavaScript for the rendering
# instead of using pre-rendered bitmaps. Use this if you do not have LaTeX
# installed or if you want to formulas look prettier in the HTML output. When
# enabled you may also need to install MathJax separately and configure the path
# to it using the MATHJAX_RELPATH option.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

USE_MATHJAX = YES

# When MathJax is enabled you can set the default output format to be used for
# the MathJax output. See the MathJax site (see:
# http://docs.mathjax.org/en/v2.7-latest/output.html) for more details.
# Possible values are: HTML-CSS (which is slower, but has the best
# compatibility), NativeMML (i.e. MathML) and SVG.
# The default value is: HTML-CSS.
# This tag requires that the tag USE_MATHJAX is set to YES.

MATHJAX_FORMAT = HTML-CSS

# When MathJax is enabled you need to specify the location relative to the HTML
# output directory using the MATHJAX_RELPATH option. The destination directory
# should contain the MathJax.js script. For instance, if the mathjax directory
# is located at the same level as the HTML output directory, then
# MATHJAX_RELPATH should be ../mathjax. The default value points to the MathJax
# Content Delivery Network so you can quickly see the result without installing
# MathJax. However, it is strongly recommended to install a local copy of
# MathJax from https://www.mathjax.org before deployment.
# The default value is: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@2.
# This tag requires that the tag USE_MATHJAX is set to YES.
